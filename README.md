# creative-excellence

> Two skills. One standard. Zero AI slop.

Creative coding skills for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) - transforms any interface from functional to exceptional through motion design, interaction patterns, and visual systems.

## Skills

### `/creative-excellence` — The Craftsman

Takes any creative request and makes it exceptional. Adapts to your stack and scope.

**Pipeline:** Scan stack → Evaluate scope → Propose interaction thesis → Load sub-skills → Implement → Mini-audit

- Detects your dependencies automatically (GSAP, Framer Motion, Three.js, CSS...)
- Proposes an **interaction thesis** before writing a single line of code
- Scales from a hover effect to a full page of scroll-driven animations
- Runs a quick audit on exit: `prefers-reduced-motion`, exit animations, layout performance

### `/design-excellence` — The Architect

Builds a complete visual universe from scratch. Brainstorm first, implement second.

**Pipeline:** Brainstorm → Define visual + interaction thesis → Generate design system → Implement → Full audit

- Mandatory creative direction session before any code
- Generates a persistent `MASTER.md` design system (palette, typography, spacing, motion tokens)
- Full audit at the end: motion gaps, accessibility, color consistency, responsive, performance
- Optional MCP integration (Stitch, Nano Banana, 21st.dev Magic)

### When to use which

| Situation | Skill |
|---|---|
| "Add a scroll animation to this section" | `/creative-excellence` |
| "Make this dropdown feel snappy" | `/creative-excellence` |
| "Redesign the entire landing page" | `/design-excellence` |
| "Build me a portfolio from scratch" | `/design-excellence` |

## Sub-skills

Internal modules loaded dynamically by the orchestrators. Not invocable directly.

| Sub-skill | Scope | Files |
|---|---|---|
| **motion-principles** | Timing, easing, enter/exit, accessibility | SKILL + 3 references |
| **gsap** | Core, timeline, ScrollTrigger, plugins | SKILL + 4 references |
| **framer-motion** | AnimatePresence, layout, gestures, motion values | SKILL + 1 reference |
| **css-native** | Scroll-driven, View Transitions, @starting-style | SKILL + 1 reference |
| **threejs-r3f** | Three.js, React Three Fiber, shaders, postprocessing | SKILL + 2 references |
| **canvas-generative** | Particles, flow fields, noise, fractals, L-systems | SKILL + 1 reference |
| **design-audit** | Motion Gap Analysis, a11y, performance, consistency | SKILL |
| **ui-ux-pro-max** | Design system intelligence (50 styles, 21 palettes, 9 stacks) | SKILL + data + scripts |

## Installation

### claude.ai (web/app)

**Prerequisites:** Plan Pro, Max, Team or Enterprise with "Code execution" enabled.

Each release provides two ways to download:

- **Individual ZIPs** - one per skill (`creative-excellence.zip`, `gsap.zip`, `motion-principles.zip`...), ready to upload directly
- **`creative-excellence-all.zip`** - a single archive containing everything. You need to **extract it first**, then upload each sub-folder as a separate ZIP (claude.ai accepts one skill per upload)

**Option A - From GitHub Releases (recommended):**

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/AThevon/creative-excellence/releases) page
2. Download the individual ZIPs (or the all-in-one and extract it)
3. On claude.ai, go to **Customize > Skills > Upload ZIP**
4. Upload each skill ZIP and enable the toggle

**Option B - Build from source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AThevon/creative-excellence.git
cd creative-excellence
./package-for-claude-ai.sh
# ZIPs are in dist/
```

> **Important:** The orchestrators (`creative-excellence`, `design-excellence`) load sub-skills dynamically. You must upload all sub-skill ZIPs too for full functionality: `motion-principles`, `gsap`, `framer-motion`, `css-native`, `threejs-r3f`, `canvas-generative`, `design-audit`, `ui-ux-pro-max`.

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
# Add the plugin marketplace
/plugin marketplace add git@github.com:AThevon/creative-excellence.git

# Install
/plugin install creative-excellence
```

Or as a git submodule in your dotfiles:

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:AThevon/creative-excellence.git claude/plugins/creative-excellence
ln -sf ~/.dotfiles/claude/plugins/creative-excellence ~/.claude/plugins/creative-excellence
```

```

Orchestrators detect the environment at runtime (Claude Code plugin directory or claude.ai `/mnt/skills/user/`) and load sub-skills via `Read`. Sub-skills in `_creative/` are never invoked directly - the underscore prefix keeps them internal.
